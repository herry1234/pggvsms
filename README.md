## Backend

Using Ionic as framework.

### With the Ionic tool:

Take the name after `ionic-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myApp blank
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myApp` and run:

```bash
$ ionic platform add ios
$ ionic build ios
$ ionic emulate ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac
